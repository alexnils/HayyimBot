This is a Telegram bot that can be used for looking up Persian words. It uses the [Hayyim](https://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/hayyim/) dictionary through Beautiful soup.

The bot is live and you can interact with it [here](https://telegram.me/HayyimBot).

You can either send a word to it directly in private chat or use the inline function from any group that you are in (just write @HayyimBot, type in a Persian word, then click on "Look up").
